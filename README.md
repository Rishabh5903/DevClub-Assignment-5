<br /> Quizzes-Contains a Question bank named-"Questions" which contains all the questions from which random questions and be selected to create a quiz. It also contains the answer bank named "Answers" which contains all the options used in all the Questions of MCQ type. I have also made the front end of the quiz. Anyone can attempt the quiz through http://localhost:8000/ .

The instructor can login through the admin portal and then go to file_uploads section to add or delete files. Each file added by instructor gets stored in a folder named 'media' in the 'Documents' folder. The uploaded files can be seen on http://localhost:8000/view or also after logging in to respective accounts.
